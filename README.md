# Portfolio
Some of my Python (and C++ and R) projects, that I'm (quite) proud of.

In the past R and C++ were in my main area of interest, but now I do rather focus on my Python skills - because it's less complicated than  C++ and more complex than R. That's why I include just one project from R and C++ and more from the latter.

## CONTENTS:

**protein_vs_gene.rmd** - school project. The correlation between occurrence of certain protein in the sample and expression of 9000 gene was investigated.

**least_squares.cpp** - implementation of linear regression with least squares method. The program was written from the very, very basic. It should be seen not as a useful tool (although it works, of course), but rather as an interesting exercise.

**spectral_analysis.py** - my own library to analyze optical spectra measured be Optical Spectrum Analyzer. That description somehow sounds not serious.

**digits_recognition.ipynb** - the CNN to recognize 0-9 digits from MNIST data set.

**genetic_algorithms.ipynb** - also a school project. The methods of genetic algorithms are used to breed a cellular automaton that, after sufficient amount of time, will turn any board covered with black and white cells into a chessboard.
